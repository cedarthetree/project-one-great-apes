				<p>Differing drastically from the orangutan, the massive gorilla spends about 90% of its life on the ground. Juveniles and smaller females make nests in trees for overnight, but the majority of large males, and even entire troops if the conditions are right, make beds in the brush and spend little, if any, time in anything but the lowest, most substantial branches.</p>

				<p>Gorillas are true knuckle walkers and spend the most time of the great apes on all-fours. Gorillas are also almost exclusively vegetarian and devote the majority of their day to foraging for fruit, leaves, roots and flowers.</p>

				<p>Despite their size and power, they are relatively peaceful creatures. Conflict is not a major part of their lifestyle and troops are generally formed as youngsters leave their birth families and form new groups.</p>
